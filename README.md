# üì∏ NiceGUI Website Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and run your **NiceGUI**-based website locally, with camera access and public sharing via **Ngrok**.

---

## üß© Installation

Before running the project, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install pillow
pip install nicegui
````

---

## üöÄ Running the Website

1. **Run your NiceGUI app locally:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   By default, this will run on **localhost:8080**.

2. **Open a new terminal** and start Ngrok to expose your local server to the web:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 8080
   ```

‚úÖ **Both terminals must remain open and running simultaneously.**

---

## üåê Setting Up Ngrok

1. **Download Ngrok**

   * You can install it directly from the **Microsoft Store** or download it from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/).

2. **Authenticate Ngrok**

   * Once downloaded, open **Command Prompt (CMD)** and run:

     ```bash
     ngrok config add-authtoken <your_token_here>
     ```
   * You can get your authentication token from your **Ngrok dashboard** after signing up for a free account.

---

## üß† Notes

* The Ngrok URL generated will allow access to your local site from **any device**, including mobile phones and tablets.
* Make sure to keep both the **local NiceGUI server** and the **Ngrok tunnel** running for external access to work.
